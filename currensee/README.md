## Description:
CurrenSee is a simple currency tracker programme designed to allow users to convert money for one currency to another based on the exchange rates at a given date. It makes use of the exchange rates provided in a CSV file. The programme prompts the user to enter several details before converting the amount and displaying the converted value with the currency symbols for the initial and target currencies.

Features
